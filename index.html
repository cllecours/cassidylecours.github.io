<H1> How to Be Economically Friendly at Walt Disney World </H1> 
<H3> Lived & Written By: Cassidy Lecours </H3> 
</div>
<p> So you may be looking at my title and conviencing your self, 
<b>"This indiviudal is crazy and has clearly never seen the ridiculous prices at 
Walt Disney World in Florida!" </b> Oh but I have, and you are correct that the prices
are out of hand. Between the money spent on transporation to arrive on top of the 
expense for lodging, park tickets, food, and entertainment, the average family of 
four could easily spend well beyond $5,000 on a week with the mouse. That is a large 
expense for a family whose child simple wants to see Olaf in real life; and for that
reason, I am here to help you.
</p>
<p> First off let me introduce myself, my name is Cassidy Lecours. Over the previous 
two decades, my family and I have camped the length and height of the United States
on a practical budget. We are your average middle class family whom simplely loves to
experience the beauty and fun of America. On May of 2017, our GPS was set on Walt Disney
World in Orlando, Florida. While I will not walk you through every economic decision my
family made, I would like to highlight three stratiges that helped my family stay on
Walt Disney property for four days for under $1,700. 
</p> 
<H2>First tip: Camp at Walt Disney World's Fort Wildrness Resort Campgroud! </H2>
<p> The property is located beside the Wilderness Lodge and contains: </p>
<ul>
 <ul style="font-family=courier;">
<li>2 pools and 3 playgrounds</li>
<li>Granite Tiled Bathrooms</li>
<li>A movie projector with nighly campfires with Chip and Dale</li>
<li> Dog parks </li>
<li> Golf carts rentals</li> 
<li> 2 Disney stores</li>
<li> 2 resturantes</li> 
<li> Boat transporation and bus transporation to all parks</li>
</ul>
</ul> 
<p> It is like the fun never ends! 
While the prices vary depending on the location and type of tent or camper you stay in, 
<em>the price of lodging per night starts at $60 a night. </em> Sixty dollars compared
to $325 per night at the Fort Wilderness Lodge that is a quarter of a mile away is pretty
great for a family vacationing on a budget! <A href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts/campsites-at-fort-wilderness-resort/"> Disney's Fort Wilderness Campground Website </A>
</P>
<h2> Second Tip: Buy the park hopper day tickets for your family. </h2>
<p> Between attending the Magic Kingdom, MGM, Epcot, and Animal Kingdom, the fun never ends.
Yet, the credit card statement may seem that they never end either. Ticket prices per park
are approximately $110 per day per person. The park prices can get well into the thousands
for a family of four wanting to see all of the parks. That is why the park hopper pass is the 
best! Yet, let me explain how... 
The park hopper pass is $160 per person per day. Yes, this is more. YET, you can hit two parks
in one day! Your family could spend the morning in Magic Kingdom, the evening in Epcot. This
strategy would allow a family to place <strong> two days worth of money into one </strong> while saving approximately
one hundred dollars that day! So what my family did was out of the four days we staying at Disney
we went to the parks only two days, yet was able to attend every park for approximately 8 hours. 
This saved my family over hundred dollars with the hopper pass. </p>

<H2> Third tip: Only go out to eat once a day </H2> 
<p> Food at Disney is incredible expensive and with a family adds up in a blink of an eye. 
One of the luxuries of staying in your camper is that it comes with a full kitchen! Therefore, 
eating out only once a day is possible. Cook your eggs in the morning to start of your magical day, 
pack sandwiches for the whole family for lumch by stopping at the local publix before your disney 
experience starts, and then go out to dinner with the family at whereever the day takes you! 
The average meal for a family of four costs between $30-$80 dollars at Disney. Therefore, 
eating in is an economically friendly option! 

<H2> Friendly Reminder: Go enjoy your family and make memories that will forever last! </h2> 
<p> Walt Disney World is a wonderful place to go. It will provide your family with smiles
that will last all day and quailty bonding time. Do not ever miss out on a family experience
simply because of money. If you make economically friendly decisions, the possibilities 
are endless! </p>
